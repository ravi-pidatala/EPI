	 * Design algorithm for computing black region that contain most points.
	 * Start from a point. One black point can not be part of two black regions.
	 * So start with a black point. Get the size of black region recording the visited nodes.
	 * After getting the size, start from another unvisited black point to get the size.
	 * Have list of point which tell black region.
	 * Time complexity is o[n] where n is number of cells.Space complexity is to o[n] for saving visited nodes and also result.
	 * Do this using DFS.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Simplify the question using ... list all the black regions in the grid.
